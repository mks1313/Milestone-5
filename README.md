# Milestone 5 — 42 Barcelona

Welcome to my **Milestone 5** repository at **Campus 42 Barcelona**! In this milestone, I have worked on the following projects: **Inception**, **Webserv**, and **CPP Modules (05-09)**. These projects allow me to showcase my skills in **DevOps**, **web server implementation**, **advanced C++ programming**, and **system-level networking**.

## Current Projects

### 1. **Inception**
**Inception** is a DevOps-oriented project where I build a complete web infrastructure using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**. The project consists of setting up and orchestrating multiple services in isolated containers, including **NGINX (with TLS)**, **WordPress**, and **MariaDB**.

Through this project, I learned how to work with **containerization**, **service isolation**, **persistent volumes**, **container networking**, and **environment-based configuration**. This provides a solid understanding of how modern web services are deployed and managed in production environments.

### 2. **Webserv**
**Webserv** consists of implementing a **HTTP/1.1 web server** in C++, inspired by servers like **NGINX**. In this project, I work with **TCP/IP sockets**, **non-blocking I/O**, and **multiplexing** (using `poll`, `select`, or equivalent). The focus is on building a robust server that handles **HTTP protocol**, **status codes**, **configuration file parsing**, and **error handling**.

This project significantly deepened my understanding of **networking at the system level**, **protocol implementation**, and how web servers work internally. The emphasis is on correctness, performance, and compliance with the HTTP specification.

### 3. **CPP Modules (CPP05 → CPP09)**
**CPP Modules** is a series of exercises focused on mastering **advanced C++ programming**. I have worked on key features such as **exceptions and error handling**, **operator overloading**, **polymorphism**, **abstraction**, **STL containers and algorithms**, **templates**, and **type casting**.

These modules follow the **C++98 standard**, emphasizing disciplined design, correct memory management, and predictable behavior. Through these exercises, I learned how to write robust, maintainable C++ code that handles complex scenarios effectively.

## My Achievements

- **Programming Languages:** C++98, with emphasis on advanced OOP and system programming.
- **Web Server Implementation:** Built a fully functional HTTP/1.1 server from scratch, handling multiple clients concurrently.
- **DevOps & Containerization:** Mastered Docker and Docker Compose to deploy multi-service web infrastructures.
- **Advanced C++:** Gained expertise in templates, STL, exceptions, and robust error handling.
- **System-Level Networking:** Deep understanding of TCP/IP, sockets, multiplexing, and non-blocking I/O.

## 📖 Technical Skills

- **C++ (C++98):** Advanced OOP, STL, templates, memory management, and exception handling.
- **Networking & HTTP:** Sockets, TCP/IP, HTTP/1.1 protocol, multiplexing, and non-blocking I/O.
- **DevOps Fundamentals:** Docker, Docker Compose, volumes, container networking, and service orchestration.
- **System Programming:** Low-level reasoning, resource control, robustness, and performance optimization.
